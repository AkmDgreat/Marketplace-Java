# MarketPlace
## Proposal
This application will provide service similar to that of *Amazon*, *Flipkart*, or *Snapdeal*. It will have different
products that buyers can view and buy. Sellers can sell whatever (legal things) they like. Sellers get to choose the
price of the product and the shipping costs. Buyers get to choose from many options.

This application can be used by buyers and sellers to sell products. Instead of going to a shop, and searching through
all the aisles, one can simply search and get what they want within minutes. Sellers can sell their product to anyone
in the world, and their services won't be limited to a neighbourhood.

I chose this project because most e-commerce applications have different apps for buying and selling (*Amazon*, for
example, has an *Amazon shopping* app and *Amazon Seller Central* for buying and selling). I want to create an app 
which does both buying and selling in a single app.
